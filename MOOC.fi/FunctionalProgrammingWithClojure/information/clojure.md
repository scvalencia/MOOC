# Functional Programming with Clojure

```clojure
(defn hello [name]
	(println "Hello," name))
```

**Functional programming** is a programming paradigm where pure functions are the basic building blocks of programs. A pure function is like a function in the mathematical sense. The outputs of the function are fully determined by its inputs. The idea is that this restriction makes your programs easier to understand. This course shows how you can code meaningful programs with mainly pure functions. Pure functional programming differs from object-oriented programming in that e.g. it does not make use of variables or loops.

The course is an introduction to functional programming with a dynamically typed language **Clojure**. We start with an introduction to Clojure; its syntax and development environment. Clojure has a good selection of data structures and we cover most of them. We also go through the basics of recursion and higher-order functions. The course material is in English.

**Clojure** is a young **Lispish** functional programming language on the **Java virtual machine (JVM)** platform, suitable for small and large programs. Because it runs on the JVM, all Clojure programs can use all the standard and third-party Java libraries freely. It offers tools for many tasks that are harder with other languages and has a special focus on concurrent programming.
