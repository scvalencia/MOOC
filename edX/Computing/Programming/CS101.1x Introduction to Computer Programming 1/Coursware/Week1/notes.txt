Computers are machines. Line other gadgets, we need to instruct the computer to perform a desired task. This task, is 
naturally of computing nature. Every computer, requires to perform such a task, a set of instructions and an order of 
execution for them. The abstract object that tells the computer the instructions and the order of their execution is
called a program. Another program called a compiler (or machine code interpreter), reads the given program, 
understand it and then gives to the machine a native language equivalent to the program. The machine executes the 
program.

In order to provide a computational description of a task to a computer, one must have two tools at hand: a 
programming language (a language to describe the task), and an algorithm (an often informal description of how to 
accomplish the task using computational instructions). The task or the algorithm (computational procedure), is a 
descritpion on what the computer must do to sove a problem. The nature of the problem must be computational.

Example:
	A tank has been erected in our yard to store water, we want to paint it, to prevent rusting. Given the painting 
	charges in Rs per sq meter, what will be the cost of painting the entire tank, along with its top cover.

	 ______
	|\____/| ===> Radius: r; Heigth: h
	|	   |
	|	   |
	\	   /
	 ------

	 Area Tank = AreaSurface + AreaCover = 2πrh + πr^2
	 A = 2πrh + πr^2
	 C = PA

	PROCEDURE SOLVE() IS
		COMMENT Mise en Place
		r, h, P := input(), input(), input()
		A := 2 * π * r * h + π * r * r
		C := P * A
		output(C)
	END PROCEDURE

	The steps of this procedure, includes get from the a potential user the variables (r, h, P).
	To calculate A given the variables, and C given P and A.
	to output to the same potentialuser, the final calculation.

	A complete procedure, must show every instruction that is desired for the computer to execute.

A more complete name, for the objects that we've been calling procedures is program. The computers transalte a 
program, and executes the semantically equivalent of that program in a language that the computer understands. Since 
a computing machines, is mainly a digital system. The language is the labguage of bits.

A computer is a perfect machine for the execution of programs since it has a lot of capabilities:

* Carry out numerical computations
* Handle numerical values
* Execute repetitive tasks

An example of a program in a low-level like language (Mr. Dumbo) is:

Use locations A, B, SUM;
Input A;
Input B;
SUM := A + B;
Output SUM;
