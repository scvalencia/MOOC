# Competitive Programming

Competitive programming, is an intellectual sport, supported by major IT companies, such as Google, Facebook, IBM. It consists of contests including logical or mathematical problems, where contestants, in order to get points, need to solve them using a computer program written in a language such as C++, Java, Pascal, etc. Contestants are generally ranked by the number of solved problems, and the running time of the whole solution. Each team or contestant, is given a set of problems that include topics such as number theory, graph theory, dynamic programming, geometry, data structures, etc. Each problem solved, is tested using an automatic judge that takes into account the constraints, and the correct solution of the problems.

The structure of each problem, consists, of a name, input and output files, time and memory limits, problem statement, input and output formats and some examples. Contestants, are suppossed to upload their solution to the automated grader and get feedback of their solutions. If the problem was solved, the time is displayed, otherwise, users get custom errors given by the online judge. Typical outcomes are:

| Outcome               | Test Number | Comment                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compilation Error     | No          | Executable file was not created after compilation.                                                       |
| Time limit exceeded   | Yes         | The program exceeds the time limit.                                                                      |
| Memory limit exceedes | Yes         | The program exceeds the memory limit.                                                                    |
| Runtime error         | Yes         | The program terminates with non-zero exit code or throws an uncaught OS exception.                       |
| Presentation error    | Yes         | The checker cannot check output because it does not match the format specified in the problem statement. |
| Wrong answer          | Yes         | The answer is not correct.                                                                               |
| Accepted              | No          | Run is accepted               

The general scheme for problem solving in a competitive programming competition is:

```basic
001. READ ALL PROBLEMS
002. SOLVE A PROBLEM
003. DEBUG THE SOLUTION ON YOUR WORKSTATION
004. SEND THE SOLUTION TO THE TEST SYSTEM
005. LOOK AT THE OUTCOME
006. IF OUTCOME = ACCEPTED THEN
007. 	GOTO 002
008. ELSE 
009. 	FIND BUGS, DEBUG IT
010. 	GOTO 004
```

The benefits of participation, include better programming and algorithmic skills, gain creative problem solving skills, prizes, and offers from top IT companies.

The main competitive programming cometitions are:

* **ACM-ICPC**: regionwise. countrywise, worldwide. Team contests of 5 hours for 12 problems, for college students.
* **IOI**: regionwise. countrywise, worldwide. Team contests of 5 hours for 12 problems, for high-schools students.
* **Google code jam**: personal global competition organized by Google, it consists of 4 rounds, 2 hours and 30 minutes per round, 3 problems per round
* **Topcoder**: personal global competition, it constits of 4 stages, 1 hour and 30 minutes per stage, 3 problems per stage.
* **Facebook HackerCup**: personal global competition, it constits of 3 stages, 3 hours per round, 6 problems per round.

Other famous cometitions are: **Yandex.Algorithm**, **VK CUP**, **Challenge 24**
