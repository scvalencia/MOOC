1. Type programs in GHCi
2. Fix the syntax errors in the program below and test your solution using GHCi
	
	N = a 'div' length xs
		where
			a = 10
		   xs = [1,2,3,4,5]

	Bugs: 'div' -> `div`
		   a, xs are not in the samen identation level
		   N is not a type, should be lowercase

	n = a `div`length xs
		where
			a = 10
			xs = [1,2,3,4,5]

3. Show how the library function last that selects the last element of the list can be defined using the functions [drop, take, length, !!]

	last [1..20] = 20
	(drop (length x - 1) x) !! 0
