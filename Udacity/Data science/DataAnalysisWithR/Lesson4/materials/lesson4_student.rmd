### Scatterplots and Perceived Audience Size
Notes:

***

### Scatterplots
Notes:

```{r Scatterplots}

```

***

#### What are some things that you notice right away?
Response:

***

### ggplot Syntax
Notes:

```{r ggplot Syntax}

```

***

### Overplotting
Notes:

```{r Overplotting}

```

#### What do you notice in the plot?
Response:

***

### Coord_trans()
Notes:

```{r Coord_trans()}

```

#### Look up the documentation for coord_trans() and add a layer to the plot that transforms friend_count using the square root function. Create your plot!

```{r}

```

#### What do you notice?

***

### Alpha and Jitter
Notes:

```{r Alpha and Jitter}

```

***

### Overplotting and Domain Knowledge
Notes:

***

### Conditional Means
Notes:

```{r Conditional Means}

```

Create your plot!

```{r Conditional Means Plot}

```

***

### Overlaying Summaries with Raw Data
Notes:

```{r Overlaying Summaries with Raw Data}

```

#### What are some of your observations of the plot?
Response:

***

### Moira: Histogram Summary and Scatterplot
See the Instructor Notes of this video to download Moira's paper on perceived audience size and to see the final plot.

Notes:

***

### Correlation
Notes:

```{r Correlation}

```

Look up the documentation for the cor.test function.

What's the correlation between age and friend count? Round to three decimal places.
Response:

***

### Correlation on Subsets
Notes:

```{r Correlation on Subsets}
with(                 , cor.test(age, friend_count))
```

***

### Correlation Methods
Notes:

***

## Create Scatterplots
Notes:

```{r}

```

***

### Strong Correlations
Notes:

```{r Strong Correlations}

```

What's the correlation betwen the two variables? Include the top 5% of values for the variable in the calculation and round to 3 decimal places.

```{r Correlation Calcuation}

```

Response:

***

### Moira on Correlation
Notes:

***

### More Caution with Correlation
Notes:

```{r More Caution With Correlation}
install.packages('alr3')
library(alr3)
```

Create your plot!

```{r Temp vs Month}

```

***

### Noisy Scatterplots
a. Take a guess for the correlation coefficient for the scatterplot.

b. What is the actual correlation of the two variables?
(Round to the thousandths place)

```{r Noisy Scatterplots}

```

***

### Making Sense of Data
Notes:

```{r Making Sense of Data}

```

***

### A New Perspective
