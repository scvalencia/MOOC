# Introduction to Programming Languages

The objective of the course, is to learn the fundamental concepts of programming languages, and take those concepts, to become a better programmer. To explain the general ideas of PLs and the expression of those ideas into different programming languages (ML, Scheme and Ruby).

* Internalize an accurate understanding of what functional and object-oriented programs mean
* Develop the skills necessary to learn new programming languages quickly
* Master specific language concepts such that they can recognize them in strange guises
* Learn to evaluate the power and elegance of programming languages and their constructs
* Attain reasonable proficiency in the ML, Racket, and Ruby languages --- and, as a by-product, become more proficient in languages they already know

This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML (in Part A), Racket (in Part B), and Ruby (in Part C) as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.

This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.

See below for a specific list of topics the course will cover.

## Background

The course assumes students are familiar with programming covered by most introductory courses, but it is explicitly designed not to be a particularly advanced course. Students should be comfortable with variables, conditionals, arrays, linked lists, stacks, and recursion (though recursion will be reviewed and expanded upon), and the difference between an interface and an implementation. Students should be eager to write programs in languages new to them. Part C of the course analyzes basic object-oriented concepts and contrasts them with those of other languages, so familiarity with Java or a closely related language (e.g., C#) may be helpful, but it is not necessary for the Part C assignments.

This course is based on a course designed for second- and third-year undergraduates: not a first computer science course, but not an advanced course either. So it certainly will not cover everything in the beautiful world of programming languages, but it is a solid introduction.
