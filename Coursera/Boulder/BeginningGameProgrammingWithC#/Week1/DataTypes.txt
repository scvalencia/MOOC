Integers (no decimals, or fractions)
	
	For memory constraint enviroments:
	byte (8 bits)
	short (16 bits)

	For normal enviroments:
	int (32 bits)
	long (64 bits)

Real numbers (decimals, or fractions)

	When we represent real numbers, we got the problem, that besides being infinite, bits are discrete entities,
	while reality is continous, so we represent approximations of real numbers.

	decimal (Perfect accuracy, small range of numbers than float. Operations are all as you'd expect. Perfect for 
			 currencies)
	float (fewer bits, smaller range of numbers and exponenets)
	double
